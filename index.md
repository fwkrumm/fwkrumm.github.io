# GitHub Repositories

My projects:

- [Repository 1](https://github.com/fwkrumm/shmlock): This module is an inter-process lock implementation that does not require passing around any objects. The lock can be used in multiple terminals or consoles by using the same name identifier. Its underlying mechanism uses the multiprocessing.shared_memory module..
- [Repository 2](https://github.com/fwkrumm/5p): This project is open-source, but it is your responsibility to verify and comply with any potential license issues. We recommend thoroughly reviewing the licenses of any dependencies or third-party code used in this project.
