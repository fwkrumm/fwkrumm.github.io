# GitHub Repositories

My projects:

- [shmlock](https://github.com/fwkrumm/shmlock): An inter-process lock implementation that does not require passing around any objects. The lock can be used in multiple terminals or consoles by using the same name identifier. Its underlying mechanism uses the multiprocessing.shared_memory module.

- [5p](https://github.com/fwkrumm/5p): A pcapplusplusplayer, a straightforward wrapper for the pcapplusplus library that forwards pcap data from a pcap(ng) file via udp/tcp by using Boost sockets. This repository uses the conan2 package manager to manage dependencies.
