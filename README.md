# GitHub Repositories

Please find below my portfolio of my projects. Your feedback is highly appreciated.

- [shmlock](https://github.com/fwkrumm/shmlock): An inter-process lock implementation (named Semaphore) that eliminates the need for passing objects around. It can be utilized across multiple terminals or consoles using the same name identifier, leveraging the `multiprocessing.shared_memory` module.

- [pymembar](https://github.com/fwkrumm/pymembar): A Python library (basically a simple C-wrapper) for memory barriers and synchronization primitives, providing efficient and portable solutions for concurrent programming.

- [5p](https://github.com/fwkrumm/5p): A straightforward wrapper for the pcapplusplus library, designed to forward pcap data from pcap(ng) files via UDP/TCP using Boost sockets. This repository employs the conan2 package manager for dependency management.
